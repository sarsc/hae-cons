      <p>Payment Terms and Agreement </p>
      <p>2.1 You are agreeing to pay for your order in accordance with our payment terms. These require a 50% deposit with the project order and 50% payment on delivery or completion of works (days and invoice amounts to define). For large scale campaigns we may agree to set timely stage payments divided equally throughout the contract. We consider a </p>
      <p>project completed if we are waiting for content from you that is preventing completion of the project. </p>

      <p>4.1 We provide a high quality design service. If you appoint us to create any design work, we will undertake a comprehensive briefing session where we request detailed information about you and your company. We will produce one design or proof based on this initial briefing exercise. If you are not happy with our initial design, we will ask you to provide appropriate feedback in writing stating where errors have been made. Following agreed changes, we will then provide a second design without further charge to you. We will always endeavour to ensure that you are satisfied with our work. </p>

Additional charges will be made should amendments be needed to a design where the changes are being made to client supplied text. </p>
