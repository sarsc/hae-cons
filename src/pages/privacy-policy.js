        After a withdrawal of consent request is received we may contact you to verify the request.

      <p>Withdrawing your consent for us to process your personal data will not affect the lawfulness of the processing beforehand.</p>
      <p>The Right of Access</p>
      <p>This grants you the right to confirm whether or not your personal data is being processed, and to be provided with all the relevant details of what those processing operations are.</p>
      <p>If you would like access to the personal data we have about you, we ask that you contact us in writing at the address shown at the end of this policy, telling us exactly what information you require, including proof of ID.</p>
      <p>We cannot give you access to your information if:</p>
      <ul>
        <p>It contains personal information about other people;</p>
        <p>A professional believes it will cause you or someone else serious physical or mental harm; and</p>
        <p>The information may interfere with preventing or detecting a crime.</p>
      </ul>
      <p>If you prefer, you can ask us to let someone act on your behalf to see your personal information, but only if you have given us written permission beforehand. </p>
      <p>Generally there is no charge whether you want to view or have a copy of your information and we have 28 days to deal with your application. However, if your request is excessive or clearly groundless, we will either charge you a reasonable administrative fee or refuse to reply. </p>
      <p>The Right of Erasure (‘Right to be Forgotten’)</p>
      <p>You have the right to request that we erase all personal data we have about you, and we must respond to that request without undue delay. There are some conditions that apply with this right, but we will make every attempt to respond to a ‘Right to be Forgotten’ request within 30 days of receipt.</p>
      <p>The Right to Rectification</p>
      <p>
        If you notice that the data we hold about you is inaccurate or incomplete, you may request we rectify the mistake. Whilst we may not always be able to change or remove that information, any factual inaccuracies
        will be corrected, and we will add your comments to the record to who has been done. Every effort will be made to respond to requests of this nature immediately.
      </p>

      <p>The Right to Portability</p>
      <p>This is a legal right afforded to you that most companies already provide; it basically states that if you request it, we must pass on all of the details you have given to us to another provider of your choosing.</p>
      <p>The Right to Complain</p>
      <p>
        We will always try to maintain the highest standards and encourage the confidence our customers have in us as an organisation.
